# CharityDAO

[CharityDAO](https://github.com/selcukemiravci/CharityDAO) is an innovative, user-friendly, single-page web application that fosters community-driven charitable giving. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Next.js, React, and blockchain solutions including XRPL and Sismo, ZK-proof, this project aims to create a secure and transparent voting platform where global users can democratically decide which country should receive the charity funds.

Within [CharityDAO](https://github.com/selcukemiravci/CharityDAO), users are presented with different countries, each represented by a unique NFT, to nominate for charity funding. Votes are cast by simply clicking on the country's image, with the system ensuring the integrity of the voting process by permitting only a single vote per user, verified by Sismo's ZK proof protocol.

To further enhance the transparency of the process, [CharityDAO](https://github.com/selcukemiravci/CharityDAO) includes a real-time vote counting feature, providing live updates on the current standings for each country.

At the end of the voting period, the funds are swiftly and cost-effectively transferred to the winning country using XRPL, a blockchain-based financial technology.

The project takes advantage of WorldID for user authentication, thus confirming the legitimacy of each vote and ensuring that only genuine individuals can participate in the voting process.

[CharityDAO](https://github.com/selcukemiravci/CharityDAO) embodies the principles of transparency, engagement, and efficiency in the realm of charitable giving. Its objective is to dispel any concerns of manipulation or corruption, while simultaneously raising awareness and involvement in global causes.

# Installation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
